# AGENTS.md

## Repository Instructions
- Keep this file minimal and actionable.
- Always update `README.md` when setup steps or main run instructions change.
- Use `docs/specs/TODO.md` as the canonical execution tracker for project tasks.
- Keep every task entry in `docs/specs/TODO.md` detailed and descriptive enough for a new agent to implement without extra context.
- When a task is completed and committed:
  - mark task as completed in `docs/specs/TODO.md`
  - add commit hash
  - add short handoff comments (risks/follow-ups/operational notes)
- Do not delete completed tasks from `docs/specs/TODO.md`; preserve history.
- Follow coding best practices.
- Always commit after successfully completing a task with a concise commit message. Ask for Human approval before commit.
- `README.md` must always include:
  - requirements
  - setup commands
  - main run commands
  - test/lint commands
